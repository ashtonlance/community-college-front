# Nextword Project

This project is a Next.js application that uses TypeScript and is configured with various development tools to enhance productivity, code quality, and performance.

## Development Tools

1. **TypeScript**

   TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. It helps catch errors early in the development process. All the components in this project are written in TypeScript.

2. **Next.js**

   Next.js is a React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. It's used as the main framework for building the application.

3. **Apollo Client**

   Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. It's used in this project to interact with the GraphQL API.

4. **Faust.js**

   Faust.js is a headless WordPress framework that provides a set of tools for building front-end applications based on WordPress backends. It's used in this project to fetch and manage data from a WordPress backend.

5. **Storybook**

   Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It's used in this project to build and test the UI components independently from the rest of the application.

6. **Jest**

   Jest is a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It's used in this project to write and run tests.

7. **ESLint**

   ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It's used in this project to enforce code quality and maintain consistency.

8. **Prettier**

   Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It's used in this project to automatically format the code to ensure it adheres to a consistent style.

9. **Husky**

   Husky is a tool that can prevent bad `git commit`, `git push` and more. It's used in this project to enforce the running of tasks before commits and pushes, such as formatting code and running tests.

10. **Tailwind CSS**

    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It's used in this project to build responsive UI with low-level utility classes.

11. **GraphQL Codegen**

    GraphQL Codegen is a tool that generates code out of your GraphQL schema. It's used in this project to automatically generate TypeScript types based on the GraphQL schema.

12. **PostCSS**

    PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. It's used in this project to process CSS.

## Scripts

The `package.json` file contains several scripts for running these tools:

```json
"scripts": {
"build": "faust build",
"dev": "faust dev",
"format": "prettier --write \"/.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,md}\"",
"lint": "eslint \".//.{js,jsx}\"",
"codegen": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.ts",
"postinstall": "husky install",
"prepare": "husky install",
"start": "faust start",
"postbuild": "next-sitemap",
"generate": "faust generatePossibleTypes",
"storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
"build-storybook": "storybook build",
"test": "jest",
"chromatic": "npx chromatic --project-token=chpt_ec41a7e2e8d8357",
"analyze": "ANALYZE=true npm run build"
}
```

## Configuration Files

Several configuration files are used to customize the behavior of the tools:

- `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compiler options.
- `jest.config.mjs`: Configures Jest testing framework.
- `next.config.js`: Configures Next.js framework.
- `postcss.config.js`: Configures PostCSS.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configures Tailwind CSS.
- `graphql.config.yaml`: Configures GraphQL Codegen.
- `faust.config.js`: Configures Faust.js.
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: Configures the generation of sitemap.
- `codegen.ts`: Configures the generation of TypeScript types from GraphQL schema.
- `jsconfig.json`: Configures JavaScript compiler options for better IDE experience.

## Components

The project uses functional React components. Each component has a `displayName` property for easier debugging. Components are organized in a modular structure, with each component in its own directory along with its associated files (like styles and tests).

## Styles

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Global styles are defined in `styles/globals.css`. Custom styles are defined in `styles/custom-styles.css`.

## Assets

The project contains several SVG assets used in the UI, such as icons and logos.

## GraphQL

The project uses GraphQL to fetch data from a WordPress backend. The GraphQL schema is defined in the WordPress backend and the frontend uses Apollo Client to interact with the GraphQL API.

## WordPress Integration

The project uses Faust.js for WordPress integration. It fetches data from a WordPress backend and uses it to generate static pages. The WordPress data is fetched at build time and used to generate static pages for better performance and SEO.

## Testing

The project uses Jest for testing. Tests are located alongside the components they are testing. The project also uses the Testing Library for React to write more user-centric tests.

## Linting and Formatting

The project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. The configuration for these tools is defined in `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` respectively. The project also uses Husky to enforce linting and formatting before commits.

## Continuous Integration

The project uses Chromatic for visual testing and review in the CI process. It's a service that helps catch visual changes in the components and provides a platform for reviewing and approving these changes. The `chromatic` script in `package.json` is used to run Chromatic.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions. The `build` script in `package.json` is used to build the project for production.

## Performance Analysis

The project uses the `analyze` script in `package.json` to analyze the bundle size of the project. This helps in identifying parts of the code that are unnecessarily large and could be optimized.

## Conclusion

This project uses a variety of development tools to ensure a smooth and efficient development process. Each tool has a specific role and contributes to the overall quality of the project. By understanding how each tool is used, you can better understand the structure and workflow of the project.
